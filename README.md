# 🏠 Housing-Price-Prediction-MLOps

An end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

This project goes beyond model training and focuses on building a complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to deployment with CI/CD automation.

## 📌 What This Project Includes

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)
- Flask web application for predictions
- Model deployment
- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
- AWS cloud hosting

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- AWS

## 🚀 Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis in Notebook
- Modular ML pipeline implementation
- Model serialization (Pickle)
- Flask API integration
- Deployment to cloud
- Automated CI/CD pipeline

## 🎯 Objective

To build a production-ready ML system instead of stopping at a Jupyter notebook.
